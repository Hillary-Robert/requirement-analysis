# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

**Purpose:**  
This repository covers the fundamental activities, techniques, and best practices for performing requirement analysis in software development. You’ll find:

- Definitions and distinctions between functional and non-functional requirements  
- Common elicitation techniques (interviews, surveys, workshops)  
- Documentation standards and templates  
- Examples and exercises to practice requirement gathering and specification  

By following the materials here, you’ll gain a clear understanding of how to gather, document, validate, and manage software requirements effectively.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the bridge between business needs and the technical solution, ensuring that the final product delivers exactly what users expect.

Key aspects of Requirement Analysis:

- **Elicitation**  
  Gathering information through interviews, workshops, questionnaires, observation, and document studies.  
- **Documentation**  
  Organizing requirements into clear, unambiguous artifacts (user stories, use cases, requirement specifications).  
- **Validation & Verification**  
  Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, consistency, feasibility, and completeness before moving on to design and development.  
- **Prioritization**  
  Ranking requirements by business value, risk, and technical dependency to guide iterative planning and resource allocation.

### Why It Matters in the SDLC

1. **Reduces Rework & Cost**  
   Catching misunderstandings early prevents costly changes in later phases (design, coding, testing).  
2. **Aligns Stakeholders**  
   Provides a shared vision of what the software must do, minimizing conflicts and scope creep.  
3. **Improves Quality**  
   Well-defined requirements become the baseline for test cases, ensuring the system meets its intended purpose.  
4. **Supports Project Planning**  
   Clear requirements allow for realistic estimates of time, effort, and budget, leading to smoother project execution.

By investing time in thorough Requirement Analysis, teams can deliver higher-quality software on time and within budget, with greater confidence that it meets user needs.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Reduces Cost and Rework**  
   Identifying and clarifying requirements early prevents misunderstandings that lead to expensive fixes later in design, development, or testing.

2. **Aligns Stakeholders and Prevents Scope Creep**  
   A well-documented set of requirements creates a shared understanding among users, business sponsors, and developers—minimizing conflicts and uncontrolled changes.

3. **Improves Product Quality**  
   Clear, testable requirements serve as the foundation for writing effective test cases, ensuring the system behaves exactly as intended.

4. **Enables Accurate Project Planning**  
   Detailed requirements allow for realistic estimates of time, effort, resources, and cost, leading to more reliable schedules and budgets.

5. **Facilitates Better Risk Management**  
   By uncovering constraints and assumptions up front, teams can identify potential technical or business risks early and plan appropriate mitigation.
